ðŸ“˜ Database Engineering with MySQL â€“ Detailed Syllabus
1. Introduction to Databases & MySQL

Relational Database Concepts

MySQL Architecture & Storage Engines (InnoDB vs MyISAM)

Data Types in MySQL (numeric, string, JSON, spatial, etc.)

ACID Properties & Transactions

2. Schema Design & Data Modeling

Database Normalization (1NF, 2NF, 3NF, BCNF)

When and why to denormalize

Entity-Relationship (ER) modeling â†’ Logical & Physical design

Primary keys, foreign keys, composite keys, surrogate keys

Partitioning strategies (horizontal, vertical, sharding)

3. Indexing & Query Optimization

Clustered vs Non-clustered indexes

Covering indexes, Composite indexes, Partial indexes

Index selectivity and cardinality

When NOT to use indexes (write-heavy scenarios)

Query Execution Plans (EXPLAIN, ANALYZE in MySQL 8+)

Common query anti-patterns (SELECT *) and optimizations

Optimizing joins (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, CROSS)

4. Advanced SQL & Query Writing

Subqueries vs Joins performance

CTEs (Common Table Expressions) and Recursive Queries

Window Functions (RANK, ROW_NUMBER, PARTITION BY)

Full-Text Search (MySQL FTS vs external tools like Elasticsearch)

JSON functions and indexing JSON data

Grouping sets, rollup, cube operations

5. Performance Tuning & Scaling

Slow Query Log analysis

Caching strategies (Query cache, Redis, Memcached)

Connection Pooling

Read replicas & Load balancing

MySQL optimizer hints

Locking & Concurrency control (row-level, gap locks, deadlocks)

6. Storage & Partitioning

Table partitioning (RANGE, LIST, HASH, KEY)

Large dataset handling (10M+ rows)

Federated tables

Archiving old data

7. Transactions & Concurrency Control

Isolation Levels (READ UNCOMMITTED, READ COMMITTED, REPEATABLE READ, SERIALIZABLE)

Deadlocks â€“ detection & resolution

Multi-version Concurrency Control (MVCC in InnoDB)

8. Backup, Recovery & Security

Logical vs Physical backups (mysqldump, Percona XtraBackup)

Point-in-time recovery

User roles, privileges, authentication plugins

Data encryption (at rest, in transit, column-level)

Auditing queries and access

9. Advanced MySQL Features

Stored Procedures & Functions

Triggers & Events

Views â€“ materialized vs non-materialized

MySQL Performance Schema & Sys Schema

MySQL 8.0 Optimizer Enhancements (Histograms, Invisible Indexes, etc.)

10. Real-World Use Cases & Best Practices

Designing schema for E-commerce (products, users, orders, reviews)

Designing schema for Social Network (users, posts, comments, likes)

Handling time-series data efficiently

Query optimization for analytical workloads (OLAP)

Migration strategies (schema changes with minimal downtime)

11. Tools & Ecosystem

MySQL Workbench, phpMyAdmin, DBeaver

Monitoring: Percona Monitoring & Management (PMM), Grafana + Prometheus

Load testing tools (sysbench, JMeter)

Schema migration tools (Flyway, Liquibase)

12. Capstone / Hands-on Projects

Build & optimize a 10M+ row database

Write and tune complex queries with joins, CTEs, and window functions

Simulate high-concurrency transactions and analyze locking behavior

Implement caching + indexing strategies for performance boost

Create partitioned tables for scalability

Perform backup + recovery drill
